I had studied English grammar many years
I thought I would study grammar
However, he surprised me
he never taught grammar rules
Instead, he told a story
He told it many times in a strange way
Honestly, I was a little confused
he was kind of a crazy teacher
after only two weeks something amazing happened
I realized that AJ was quite clever
She learned extra fast
you must follow Rule 2
Angelina quickly improved speaking
when she stopped studying grammar
Put away your grammar books and textbooks
discuss the most important rule for speaking English easily
Congratulations on your teaching program
I am learning a lot through your lessons
Grammar rules teach you to think about English
you want to speak automatically without thinking
