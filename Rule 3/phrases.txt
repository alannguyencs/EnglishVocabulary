He studied English in Venezuela for many years
He moved to Canada a few years ago
He thought his English was good
when he came to Canada he was surprised and shocked
he couldn't understand anyone
He joined an English school in Canada
He went to school everyday
Humberto was angry and frustrated
I was very upset
this is a waste of time
I wasted so much time with schools
Thank God I found a better way

Stop reading textbooks
Start listening everyday

Your speaking improves quickly
