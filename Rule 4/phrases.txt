I'm a very serious student
I memorized 50000 English words for a big test
I could pass an English test
But I could not understand native speakers
I learned to instantly understand English
Her learning was short and shallow
learn every word and phrase DEEPLY
It's not enough to know a definition
You must put the word deep into your brain
just repeat all lessons or listening many times
