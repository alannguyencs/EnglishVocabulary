Fluency means you can talk easily with native speakers
Fluency is your most important English goal
have a lot of understandable repetitive listening
learn English with your ears, not with your eyes
In other words, you must listen
Your ears are the key to excellent speaking
If you do not understand, you will not improve
you should listen mostly to easy English
Most students listen to English that is much too difficult
If you hear a new word only once, you will soon forget it
How many times is necessary
hear a new word 30 times to remember it forever
trying to listen to many different kinds of things
all speakers have favorite vocabulary and grammar
Another example is to choose one topic to focus on
we listened to interviews with actors in the movie
dividing your listening time is best
to divide that time during the day
By dividing your time throughout the day
this is the exact schedule I recommend to my students
you can carry your English lessons everywhere
Only watch one scene or segment per week
First, watch the scene with subtitles in your language
help you understand the general meaning
Listening and Reading together are very powerful
put away the text and just listen
Follow the above suggestions
I have been teaching over 10 years
Every student who follows these methods succeeds
I wish you success with your English learning
